//reducer function which is a pure function

//no longer required

// export const initialState={
//     dishes:DISHES,
//     comments:COMMENTS,
//     promotions:PROMOTIONS,
//     leaders:LEADERS
// };

// export const Reducer=(state = initialState,action)=>//current state and action to be performed
// {
//     //So, what I'm going to do is I will make use of the ES6 way of defining functions
//     // where you can specify the default value for a parameter, and then 
//     //I'll say, state equals to initialState. So, when the reducer is first called by my store,
//     // my store would have no state, so the state will be uninitialized. So it will be undefined
//     // there. So, in order to avoid issues with that I'm going to say that if the state is undefined,
//     // the default value will be initialState which I have just defined earlier
// return state;
// };
